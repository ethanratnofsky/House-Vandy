## Problem Statement
We want to be able to evaluate when certain apartments fall into a range that is affordable for students. Students living off campus have a problem finding affordable housing around campus so that they could find a place to move into for the next school year. They have to constantly check different websites to see if prices have dropped which takes time. People want to be able to save more time and streamline the process. Our solution would address those problems users have.
